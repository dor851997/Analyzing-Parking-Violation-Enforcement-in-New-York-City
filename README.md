# Analyzing Parking Violation Enforcement in New York City

## Project Overview

This project aims to assist the New York City government in analyzing the enforcement of parking violations within its jurisdiction. Each year, NYC issues over 10 million parking violation tickets. To streamline the analysis, 3% of these records were randomly selected from the dataset available on the Open Data NYC website.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive overview of parking violation enforcement in NYC using tools and techniques learned in our course. The project simulates the work of a BI analyst embarking on a new data analysis project. The key tasks include:

- Developing SQL queries to analyze the data.
- Preparing the data for analysis using the Power BI query editor.
- Creating visualizations in Power BI to present the findings.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Power BI**: Used for data preparation, analysis, and visualization.
- **SQL**: Used for querying and analyzing the dataset.

## Data Source

The dataset was sourced from the [Open Data NYC](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) portal, specifically focusing on parking violation records.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Import and Preparation**: The data was imported into Power BI, where initial cleaning and preparation were performed using the query editor.
2. **SQL Analysis**: Custom SQL queries were developed to extract meaningful insights from the data.
3. **Visualization**: Various visualizations were created in Power BI to represent the data analysis results effectively.

## Visualizations

Here are some screenshots showcasing the Power BI visualizations created during the project:
